# Instrument practice

When you have a new instrument, you might not know where all the notes are. I just bought myself a button accordion, and I'm very rusty.

This web app shows you a note and asks you to play it. It uses a simple monophonic pitch tracking algorithm to figure out which note you're playing. If you get it right, you get a new note.

You can set the range of notes for your instrument using the controls on the page. If you play a note outside of the range it won't show up.

The pitch tracker works reasonable for accordion and guitar, and sort of works for voice. Tested in Chrome.
